Population Dynamics Template Model

This is an explicit use case of the lsd population module you may access here:
https://github.com/FrederikSchaff/lsd-module-pop

it works with LSD-GIS, which you can get here:
https://github.com/FrederikSchaff/Lsd

Objective: This is a template model, to be used as a starting point for LSD
models where an explicit population model is wanted that includes a heritage
network that survives the agents and allows, for example, to check family
degrees.

The model allows to add statistical population models. Currently one
model is added, called "BLL", following:

In addition, the Wedding Ring model is implemented explicitly to define partner
search:

For information on how the back-end works, please take a look at the (yet
scarce, I admit) documentation of the population module and the
accompanying paper (to be comming).
