Population Dynamics Template Model

```

This is an explicit use case of the lsd population module you may access here:
https://github.com/FrederikSchaff/lsd-module-pop

it works with LSD-GIS, which you can get here:
https://github.com/FrederikSchaff/Lsd

Objective: This is a template model, to be used as a starting point for LSD
models where an explicit population model is wanted that includes a heritage
network that survives the agents and allows, for example, to check family
degrees.
